# Use user spam notifications to release and report quarantined messages in Office 365

If your admin enables spam notifications for users, you'll receive a notification message that lists messages addressed to your mailbox that were identified as spam and quarantined instead.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you're an administrator and want to enable this feature, you can choose the option when you [modify a default anti-spam policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=800313). 
  
The message you receive includes the number of spam-quarantined messages you have, and the date and time (in Universal Coordinated Time or UTC) of the last message in the list. The list includes the following for each message:
  
- **Sender** The send name and email address of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Subject** The subject line text of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Date** The date and time (in UTC) that the message was quarantined. 
       
These are the actions that you can take with a quarantined message:

- **Block Sender** if you want Office 365 to add the sender to your blocked senders list.

- **Review** to navigate to the Quarantine Portal within the Security and Compliance Center if you want to take other actions, such as Preview or Release.

Be aware of the following:
  
- Only spam-quarantined messages are listed. Messages that are quarantined because of other reasons are not included in user quarantined messages. 
    
- You can only release a message and report it as a false positive (not junk) once.
